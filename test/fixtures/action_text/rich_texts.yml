    <p>These videos take you end-to-end through a project that creates a ruby gem.
    (The subject matter of polyhedral dice was chosen because Mike\'s a giant nerd.)
    The series covers a number of programming concepts that will help you be a better
    software developer, particularly in Ruby.</p>

    <p>Inspired by Simon Sinek\'s brilliant video Start with Why, these videos explain the
    North Star of Stateless Code. What gets us out of bed in the morning and motivates
    us to keep producing videos? Why do we do what we do? What is the dream for this
    organization? Start at the center of the Golden Circle and communicate outward rather
    than on the outside and communicating inward. Are we just being lazy video editors by
    leaving the mistakes in our videos? Why the Jesus is Lord in the footer and the
    in-your-face anarchy symbol in the branding? These videos are here to remind ourselves
    of our promise to you. Taking the time to stop and think about the Why will help you
    prioritize and avoid mission creep.</p>
